	<h2>Locate</h2>
	<p>
		There are a number of ways to use landsat-util to download imagery, but it's
		easiest if you know the path and row of the location you're interested in.
	</p>

	<p><strong>Use the map to identify the path and row of the location you're interested in.</strong></p>

	<div id='paths-and-rows' class='map'></div>
	<script src='src/js/paths-and-rows.js'></script>

	<p>For this guide, we're going to be using the scenes available at Path 22 - Row 39, which includes New Orleans.</p>
